# A Visual Method For Adressing Large Collections

## Abstract

## The Problem
## Finding The Best Fractal
The optimal fractal curve should have the following characteristics:

+ should span the space with a resonable degree of:
	+ homegenity
	+ bound to a foreseable rectangle region
+ should not generate intersection with itself
+ be generated by simple rules (ideally L-System)
+ a reasonable degree of "neighborhooding"
+ high degree of local symmetry
+ minimal variation of geometric shapes of elements
+ simple formulae for finding the exact location of a point value on any iteration

Optional/preferable characteristics

+ improved redability by:
	+ minimal variation of angles
	+ or continous curve without angles

A Hilbert curve produced by the L-System:
Start: X
Rules: X=+YF-XFX-FY+;Y=-XF+YFY+FX-;F=F
Angle: 90 deg

Meets the most characteristics. Even better when the 90 degree angles are rounded.

Hoever we can find an even better solution that retains all the advantageous characteristics of Hilbert and even upgrade on local symmetry, minimisation of used shapes.
We will explore the curve produced by:
Start: F
Rules: F=FF+FFF+FF
Angle: 90 deg

The initial shape that spans the F is a circle arc with a 90 deg angle in order to provide a continous curve without angles. For this purpuse the positions 2, 3, 5, 6 of the first rule have to have inverse sense than the arc on positions 1, 4, 7.
